imagesizer
==========

Takes URL parameters and automatically resizes images, based on CodeIgniter (not a library)

This is still alpha code but here is a URL example:
http://yourdomain.com/imageresizer/imager/resize/550x550/sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/881950_10200895843983902_1054675483_o.jpg
